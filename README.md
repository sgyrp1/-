# 英国毕业生薪资可视化与建模

1. Introduction

As employment environment becomes severe, the employment issue of graduates has always been the focus of public opinion. It is of far-reaching significance to explore the impact of multiple factors on graduates' salaries and put forward suggestions and strategies in related fields. This report draws on survey data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency on the baseline profile of UK graduates in the 2020-2021 academic year. The goal is further data visualization, analysis and modeling. The survey indicator on graduate wages covers the annual earnings (before tax) of graduates in their main jobs during the census week.

The survey covers graduates from a range of subjects across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, ranging from first-year undergraduates to students studying for a master's degree. A variety of routes to degree qualifications are considered. Institutional data contributions are from higher education institutions and colleges of further education.

Job classifications in the survey were divided into high, medium and low categories based on constructs such as "skill level" and "skill specialization." These classifications take into account factors such as training duration, necessary work experience, and knowledge prerequisites for task performance . Additionally, the survey asked whether graduates view work as an activity or as a primary pursuit.

1.1 Research Questions

We have a strong interest in investigating income differences between graduates with different backgrounds, geographical areas and career choices. Our goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the initial earnings of graduates exhibiting different characteristics. Furthermore, we aim to explore the impact of graduates' chosen field of specialization and the degree pursued during their academic tenure on their subsequent earnings levels. The subtle interplay between these educational and occupational factors and the types of jobs graduates choose subsequently is of particular interest in explaining the determinants of earnings changes early in their careers .

1.2 Objectives

(a) Conduct exploratory data analysis to review the data set, employing advanced data visualization techniques to analyze salary distributions between different categories of graduates.

(b) Use the training data set to develop a classification model with the goal of predicting salary levels, using the basic characteristics of graduates as predictive features.

(c) Investigate the importance of factors that affect graduates’ salary levels, aiming to establish an importance ranking of factors based on income levels and quantify the relative impact of various factors on graduates’ salary fluctuations.
